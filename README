NAME
    WWW::HtmlUnit - Inline::Java based wrapper of the HtmlUnit v2.14 library

SYNOPSIS
      use WWW::HtmlUnit;
      my $webClient = WWW::HtmlUnit->new;
      my $page = $webClient->getPage("http://google.com/");
      my $f = $page->getFormByName('f');
      my $submit = $f->getInputByName("btnG");
      my $query  = $f->getInputByName("q");
      $page = $query->type("HtmlUnit");
      $page = $query->type("\n");

      my $content = $page->asXml;
      print "Result:\n$content\n\n";

DESCRIPTION
    This is a wrapper around the HtmlUnit library. It includes the HtmlUnit
    jar itself and it's dependencies. All this library really does is find
    the jars and load them up using Inline::Java.

    The reason all this is interesting? HtmlUnit has very good javascript
    support, so you can automate, scrape, or test javascript-required
    websites.

    See especially the HtmlUnit documentation on their site for deeper API
    documentation, <http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/apidocs/>.

INSTALLING
    There is one special thing that I've run into when installing
    Inline::Java, and thus WWW::HtmlUnit, which is telling the installer
    where to find your java home. It turns out this is really really easy,
    just define the JAVA_HOME environment variable before you start your
    CPAN shell / installer. From Debian/Ubuntu, I do:

      sudo apt-get install default-jdk
      sudo JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/default-java cpanm WWW::HtmlUnit

    and everything works the way I want!

DOCUMENTATION
    You can get the bulk of the documentation directly from the HtmlUnit
    apidoc site <http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/apidocs/>. Since
    WWW::HtmlUnit is mostly a wrapper around the real Java API, what you
    actually have to do is translate some of the java notation into perl
    notation. Mostly this is replacing '.' with '->'.

    Key classes that you might want to look at:

    WebClient
    <http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/apidocs/com/gargoylesoftware/htmlunit/W
    ebClient.html>
        Represents a web browser. This is what "WWW::HtmlUnit->new" returns.

    HtmlPage
    <http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/apidocs/com/gargoylesoftware/htmlunit/h
    tml/HtmlPage.html>
        A single HTML Page.

    HtmlElement
    <http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/apidocs/com/gargoylesoftware/htmlunit/h
    tml/HtmlElement.html>
        An individual HTML element (node).

    Also see WWW::HtmlUnit::Sweet for a way to pretend that HtmlUnit works a
    little like WWW::Mechanize, but not really.

MODULE IMPORT PARAMETERS
    In general, any parameters you pass while importing ('use'-ing)
    WWW::HtmlUnit will be passed on to Inline::Java. A handy one is the
    'DIRECTORY' parameter, for example. A few parameters are handled
    specially, however.

    If you need to include extra .jar files, and/or if you want to study
    more java classes, you can do:

      use HtmlUnit
        jars => ['/path/to/blah.jar'],
        study => ['class.to.study'];

    and that will be added to the list of jars for Inline::Java to
    autostudy, and add to the list of classes for Inline::Java to
    immediately study. A class must be on the study list to be directly
    instantiated.

    Whether you ask for it or not, WebClient, BrowserVersion, and Cookie
    (each in the com.gargoylesoftware.htmlunit package) are studied. You can
    get to studied classes by adding WWW::HtmlUnit:: to their package name.
    So, you could make a cookie like this:

      my $cookie = WWW::HtmlUnit::com::gargoylesoftware::htmlunit::Cookie->new($name, $value);
      $webClient->getCookieManager->addCookie($cookie);

    Which is, incidentally, just the sort of thing that I should wrap in
    WWW::HtmlUnit::Sweet or elsewhere, 'cause that is UGLY!

METHODS
  $webClient = WWW::HtmlUnit->new($browser_name)
    This is just a shortcut for

      $webClient = WWW::HtmlUnit::com::gargoylesoftware::htmlunit::WebClient->new;

    The optional $browser_name allows you to specify which browser version
    to pass to the WebClient->new method. You could pass "FIREFOX_3" for
    example, to make the engine especially try to emulate Firefox 3 quirks,
    I imagine.

DEPENDENCIES
    When installed using the CPAN shell, all dependencies besides java
    itself will be installed. This includes the HtmlUnit jar files, and in
    fact those files make up the bulk of the distribution, byte-wise.

TIPS
  Working with java list/collections
    When you get a java list, it is actually an object-thingie. You gotta
    call "->toArray()" on it, and then you'll get a lovely perl arrayref,
    which is most likely what you wanted in the first place. I am open to
    suggestions for a mass work-around for this.

  HTTP Authentication
      my $credentialsProvider = $webclient->getCredentialsProvider;                           
      $credentialsProvider->addCredentials($username, $password);

  Disable SSL certificate checking
      $webclient->setUseInsecureSSL(1);

  Handling alerts and confirmations
    We (thanks lungching!) wrote a wee bit of java to make this easy. Though
    I admit that it could be a bit more... perlish. For a full example, see
    "03_clickhandler.t" in t.

      my $alert_handler = WWW::HtmlUnit::com::gargoylesoftware::htmlunit::CollectingAlertHandler->new();
      $webClient->setAlertHandler($alert_handler);
      # ...
      my $alert_arrayref = $alert_handler->getCollectedAlerts->toArray();

TODO
    *   Capture HtmlUnit output to a variable

    *   Use that to have a quiet-mode

    *   Document lungching's confirmation handler code, automate build
